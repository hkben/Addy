## FAQ

_Why not just use the web clipper that come with Note-Taking Apps?_

Many web clipper required you to login to your Note-Taking app account. It means you cannot use them in Incognito Mode / Private Browsing or other profiles / browsers that you don't want to login to your account. We hope this tool can works without login.
